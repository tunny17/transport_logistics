<h1>Problems Faced</h1>
The major problem I faced was the sizing issue, to back up this problem, when you play the prototype of the figma file, the viewport is bigger than it ought to. I believe the Frame used to create the figma file is bigger than the normal desktop width. However I could be wrong, so far that's the only problem I faced.
